## Hi there 👋

Do what you love, right? I fell in love with coding when I started the course IT-Tech for Women where I delved into the fundamentals of front end development. After that I was hooked and wanted to learn more. I began studying full stack development with Chas Academy Yrkeshögskola (Sept 2024) and have been completely submerged in the world of programming. 

- 🔭 I’m currently studying Full Stack Development at Chas Academy Yrkeshögskola. This two-year program focuses on web development skills, with a particular emphasis on JavaScript, TypeScript, and SQL. The program also provides in-depth knowledge of technical frameworks such as React and Express, backend development with Node.js for creating APIs, and working with various databases.

- 💬 Ask me about accessibility. I am particularly interested in the intersection of technology and accessibilityI because I believe technology should make the world as accessilbe as possible for everyone.
